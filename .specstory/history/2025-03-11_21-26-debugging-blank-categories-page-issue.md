_**Assistant**_

I apologize, but I don't see any code from the categories page in the provided context. To help debug why the categories page is blank and not working, I'll need to see:

1. The categories page component code
2. Any related API routes
3. Any database queries or models related to categories

Could you please share the relevant code files? This would help me identify why the page isn't displaying properly and suggest the necessary fixes.

Specifically, it would be helpful to see:
- `pages/categories.tsx` (or similar)
- Any category-related API routes
- Any category-related database models/queries
- Any error messages you're seeing in the console
